# Request Handler

The `requestHandler` is the core of how VueList fetches data. It's a globally defined async function that VueList calls every time the listing state changes â€” whether it's the page number, filters, sorting, or search input.

You define the logic once, and VueList handles calling it with the right parameters at the right time.

This function is responsible for:

- Making the actual API request (using fetch, axios, or your library of choice)
- Structuring the request based on the current listing state
- Returning the resolved data (ideally the list of items + any pagination metadata)

## Arguments

When called, the `requestHandler` receives a single argument - an object called `context`.
This context contains everything needed to perform the API call.

Read more about [The Context Object](/configuration/context-object.md).

::: code-group

```js [main.js]
app.use(VueList, {
  requestHandler(context) {
    const {
      endpoint,
      version,
      meta,
      search,
      page,
      perPage,
      sortBy,
      sortOrder,
      filters,
      attrSettings,
    } = context;
    //...
  },
});
```

:::

## Return Value

The requestHandler must return a Promise that resolves with the following object:

```js
{
  items: Array,
  count: Number,
}
```

Following are the properties of the returned object.

### items

- type: `Array`

  The sliced data returned from an API to show on this page.

### count

- type: `Number`

  The total number of items matching the filters which is used for pagination.

For example:
::: code-group

```js [main.js]
app.use(VueList, {
  requestHandler(context) {
    // ...
    return axios
      .get(...)
      .then((res) => {
        return {
          items: res.data,
          count: res.count,
        };
      }).catch(error=>{
        // Handle error
        const err = new Error('Failed to fetch data')
        err.name = 'NetworkError'
        throw err
      });
  },
});
```

## Error Handling

The `requestHandler` function is expected to return a Promise. If that promise is rejected, VueList catches the failure and passes the error object down to `<VueListError>`.

::: warning Heads up!
If you include a catch block in the `requestHandler` function but don't explicitly throw the error, VueList won't be able to detect and handle the error appropriately.

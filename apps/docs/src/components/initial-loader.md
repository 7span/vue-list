# `<VueListInitialLoader>`

This component is for the very first load â€” when the list has not yet received any data. This is useful to show a skeleton loader or shimmer when the user first visits the page.

```vue
<template>
  <VueListInitialLoader>
    <!-- Render your skeleton/shimmer here -->
  </VueListInitialLoader>
</template>
```

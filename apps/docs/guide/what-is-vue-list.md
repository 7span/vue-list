## Brief Concept

Vue List aims to allow developer to get a full control of pagination. Rather than using a full pagination library with the template included, you can embed pagination functionalities on your own template as long as it uses Vue.js. By using this way, you have a full flexibility with pagination without having to breakdown your current template. SSPaging can be used everywhere in your template, without forcing you to use template from pagination library itself.
